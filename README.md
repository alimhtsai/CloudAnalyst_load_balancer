# CloudAnalyst_load_balancer
Implementation of Load Balancing and Case Study through Cloud Analyst

Cloud computing integrates data and computing in large regional data centers and transmits data remotely through the network, which has the advantages of instant data transmission and low cost. To allow developers to balance the trade-off between the distance and efficiency between terminal devices and data centers in different regions during the development phase, CloudAnalyst is used to simulate cloud resource access load balancing by different algorithms in similar environments. This study firstly compares the performance of the existing three CloudAnalyst algorithms with the first-come-first-served algorithm and the artificial bee colony algorithm. Furthermore, it uses a real-world case for cloud computing applications. The result shows that under the same conditions, we can obtain the best load balancing performance through the artificial bee colony algorithm; on the opposite, the worst performance is obtained by using the first-come-first-served algorithm.
